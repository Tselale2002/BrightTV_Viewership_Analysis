* Saved all the graphs as pictures to be uploaded on CANVA for presentation.
  
**Step 5: Presentation Report (Canva)**

* Created presentation report on CANVA.

* Uploaded all the saved graphs on CANVA.

* Then compiled the report accordingly.

**Step 6: Visualisation and Dashboards Creation (Google Looker Studio)**
